This is my first project as I embark on my journey into web development.
As a dedicated learner, I am focusing on mastering the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, while also gaining hands-on experience with JavaScript.

I thrive on learning quickly, adapting to new challenges, and finding effective solutions to any problem I encounter.
 This project is a stepping stone in my growth as a developer, and I am eager to continue improving and expanding my skill set.
